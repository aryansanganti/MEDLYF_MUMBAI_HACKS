# Fusion Starter

A production-ready React SPA application template with TypeScript, Vitest, Zod and modern tooling.

While the starter comes with a client-only setup, only create endpoints when strictly necessary, for example to encapsulate logic that must live on the server, such as private keys handling, or certain DB operations, db...

## Tech Stack

- **PNPM**: Prefer pnpm
- **Frontend**: React 18 + React Router 6 (spa) + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS 3
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **UI**: Radix UI + TailwindCSS 3 + Lucide React icons

## Project Structure

```
client/                   # React SPA frontend
├── pages/                # Route components (Index.tsx = home)
├── components/ui/        # Pre-built UI component library
├── App.tsx                # App entry point and with SPA routing setup
└── global.css            # TailwindCSS 3 theming and global styles

shared/                   # Types used by client
└── api.ts                # Example of how to share api interfaces
```

## Key Features

## SPA Routing System

The routing system is powered by React Router 6:

- `client/pages/Index.tsx` represents the home page.
- Routes are defined in `client/App.tsx` using the `react-router-dom` import
- Route files are located in the `client/pages/` directory

For example, routes can be defined with:

```typescript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
  {/* ADD ALL CUSTOM ROUTES ABOVE THE CATCH-ALL "*" ROUTE */}
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>;
```

### Styling System

- **Primary**: TailwindCSS 3 utility classes
- **Theme and design tokens**: Configure in `client/global.css` 
- **UI components**: Pre-built library in `client/components/ui/`
- **Utility**: `cn()` function combines `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes

```typescript
// cn utility usage
className={cn(
  "base-classes",
  { "conditional-class": condition },
  props.className  // User overrides
)}
```

### Shared Types
Import consistent types in client:
```typescript
import { DemoResponse } from '@shared/api';
```

Path aliases:
- `@shared/*` - Shared folder
- `@/*` - Client folder

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm dev        # Start dev server (client)
pnpm build      # Production build
pnpm typecheck  # TypeScript validation
pnpm test          # Run Vitest tests
```

## Adding Features

### Add new colors to the theme

Open `client/global.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` and add new tailwind colors.

### New Page Route
1. Create component in `client/pages/MyPage.tsx`
2. Add route in `client/App.tsx`:
```typescript
<Route path="/my-page" element={<MyPage />} />
```

## Production Deployment

- **Standard**: `pnpm build`
- **Cloud Deployment**: Use either Netlify or Vercel via their MCP integrations for easy deployment. Both providers work well with this starter template.

## Architecture Notes

- Client-only with Vite for rapid development
- TypeScript throughout (client, shared)
- Full hot reload for rapid development
- Production-ready with multiple deployment options
- Comprehensive UI component library included
- Type-safe API communication via shared interfaces
